This directory contains a spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP)[1]
Driver. It uses bispectrum components to characterize the local neighborhood
of each atom in a very general way. The driver is written in C++ and it
expects a SNAP coefficient file followed by a SNAP parameter file.

The format of the SNAP coefficient file is as follows:

* Blank lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.

* Line 0 : nelem, ncoeff
   - nelem     : number of elements
   - ncoeff    : number of coefficients

* One block for each of the nelem elements.
* Line 1 of each block : Element, R, W
   - Element   : Element symbol (text string)
   - R         : Element radius (distance units)
   - W         : Element weight (dimensionless)
* Line 2,3,...,ncoeff+1 of each block : coeffs
   - coeffs    : SNAP coefficients, one per line.

The format of the SNAP parameter file is as follows:

* Blank lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.
* Non-blank and non-comment lines must contain one keyword/value pair.

* The required keywords are rcutfac and twojmax.
* Optional keywords are rfac0, rmin0, switchflag, bzeroflag, and quadraticflag.
