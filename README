This directory contains a spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP)[1]
Driver. It uses bispectrum components to characterize the local neighborhood
of each atom in a very general way. The driver is written in C++ and it
expects a SNAP coefficient file followed by a SNAP parameter file.

The format of the SNAP coefficient file is as follows:

* Blank lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.

* Line 0 : nelem, ncoeff
   - nelem     : number of elements
   - ncoeff    : number of coefficients

* One block for each of the nelem elements.
* Line 1 of each block : Element, R, W
   - Element   : Element symbol (text string)
   - R         : Element radius (distance units)
   - W         : Element weight (dimensionless)
* Line 2,3,...,ncoeff+1 of each block : coeffs
   - coeffs    : SNAP coefficients, one per line.

The format of the SNAP parameter file is as follows:

* Blank lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.
* Non-blank and non-comment lines must contain one keyword/value pair.

* The required keywords are rcutfac and twojmax.
* Optional keywords are rfac0, rmin0, switchflag, bzeroflag, and quadraticflag.


------------------------------  Hybrid style  -------------------------------

SNAP can be used in a hybrid style and in combination with a
Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL)[2] screened nuclear repulsion potential and
any other two-body interaction in the table style[3] representation.

The format of the HYBRID parameter file is as follows:

* HYBRID style parameters (extra 'zbl' and two-body pair styles
* as a table style can be assigned)
*
* NOTE:
*   No mixing rule will be used here.
*
*   Each pair (I,J) or (J,I) can be assigned to one style
*   If you specify the same pair for the second time, it wipes
*   out all the previous assignments of that pair and the
*   second one will be calculated for the two interacting atoms
*   of those types.


* Number of elements for the hybrid style
   - N
* Number of elements names, (atom names)
   - Element_1 Element_2 ... Element_N

* In the ZBL style, the inner and outer cutoff are the
* same for all pairs of atom types.
   - zbl  inner  outer
*
   - Element_1  Element_2  zbl  Z_1  Z_2


* Table style:
   - table  style  N

* style = 'lookup' or 'linear' or 'spline' or 'bitmap' =
* method of interpolation
* N     = use N values in 'lookup', 'linear', 'spline' tables
* N     = use 2^N values in 'bitmap' tables
*

   - Element_1  Element_2  table  style_number  filename  keyword  [cutoff]

* 'table' style can be used multiple times. For example, interactions between
* I and I atoms use a 'linear' table style and interactions between I and J
* atoms use a 'spline' table style, then you should list the table style two
* times. Style indexing starts from '1'. It means, that the fisrt style is
* numbered '1' and the second '2' and so on so forth.
* Later in the pair interactions, the 'table' style must be added after the
* I,J atom names followed by the style number and then followed by the
* remaining coefficients as of 'filename', and 'keyword', and 'cutoff'.
*
* The 'filename' specifies a file containing tabulated energy
* and force values.
* The 'keyword' specifies a section of the file.
* The 'cutoff' is an optional coefficient in distance unit.
*
*
* Example 1, we use 2 styles
* table  linear  1000
* table  spline  10000
* I  I  table  1  II.table IIKey 4.0
* I  J  table  2  IJ.table IJ
*
*
* Example 2, we use one style
* table  spline  10000
* I  I  table  1  II.table IIKey 4.0
* I  J  table  1  IJ.table IJ
*
*
* Example 3, we use one style and have one tabulated file
* table  spline  10000
* I  I  table  1  tablefile.txt II 4.0
* I  J  table  1  tablefile.txt IJ 4.8
